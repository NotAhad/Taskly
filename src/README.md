## Overview

Taskly is built to simulate a real-world task management system where administrators can create, assign, and monitor tasks, while employees can view and update their task statuses. The application leverages:

- **React Hooks:** useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef for managing state and interactions.
- **Local Storage:** For data persistence without a backend.
- **Tailwind CSS:** To achieve a modern, responsive UI design.
- **Custom Features:** Such as drag scrolling in activity panels and custom form validations.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access:** Separate dashboards for admins and employees.
- **Task Management:** Create, assign, and track tasks.
- **User Authentication:** Simple login flow using local storage.
- **Drag Scrolling:** Custom implementation for intuitive scrolling of task/activity lists.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to support various device sizes.
- **Data Persistence:** Employees and admin data are persisted across sessions via local storage.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/taskly.git
   cd taskly

   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run: npm install

3. **Run the Application:**

   npm start

   This command starts the development server. Open http://localhost:3000 to view the application in your browser.

## Usage

**Login:**
On load, the application displays a login screen. Use the credentials from the pre-populated local storage (for admin or employee). For example:
Admin: a1@gg.com
Employee: e1@gg.com (or others from the local storage data)

**Admin Dashboard:**

- **Task Management:** Create tasks using the form in the dashboard. On task creation, the selected employeeâ€™s task list and task counts update.
- **Activity Panels:** View user task statistics and activity logs with smooth drag scrolling.

**Employee Dashboard:**

- **View your assigned tasks and their statuses.**
- **Accept or decline tasks using the provided interface.**

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Animations:** Incorporate GSAP animations for smooth transitions and interactive feedback.
- **Accessibility Enhancements:** Add keyboard navigation support and further ARIA attributes.
- **Backend Integration:** Replace local storage with a backend API for user authentication and persistent task management.
